how to querry through supabase

1.make sure your supabase client is set up which contains your supabase url and anon key, 
2.import the supabase client in your component
in your project you can now querry 

you can destructure the querry's return {data, error}

now make these variables which is a destructured data and error, you can also rename it through data:newname
const {data,error}
data is what the return is, error is if it encounters error

make sure btw that its an async because fetching from the database is async
const {data,error} = await supabase.from("table).select("*").eq(first arg,second arg)this compares the two if its equal
then for handling error you can do if(error){handleerror}
